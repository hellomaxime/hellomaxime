<h1 align="center"> Hello everyone ! </h1>
</br>
I'm Maxime, a Data Engineer who recently graduated with a master's degree in computer science from :fr: Sorbonne University. I have a strong interest in building data pipelines and applying concepts to transform data into useful information for data scientists and decision makers. Beyond data, I'm also interested in software engineering and I spend my free time learning new things and improving my knowledge. I would also love to contribute to Open Source.

<h2 align="center"> Big Data </h2>

</br>
My repositories are mainly about data where I share some pieces of code that show how big data tools work with each others. The following schema shows all the big data technos I have worked with and planned to learn in a near future. As I'm talking about big data tools, I would like to point out that knowing concepts like data modeling is more important than knowing how to use a tool.
