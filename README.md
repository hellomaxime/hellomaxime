# Welcome to my GitHub profile !

Things here are mainly about Data Engineering as it is the field I chose to work in.

I think it is a good start as I'm still a junior Data Engineer.

I have split the elements in the schema into multiple repositories. Feel free to take a look at them :)  


## This is not the only things I did

I have also learned other tools such as Kubernetes or Docker. You can look my techninal skills on my resume.
